       " \"Doctor: Hello, ma'am. What is the reason for your visit today? \\r\\nPatient: I was referred by a doctor to come see you so that you could check up on my nasal problems. Here is my report from my previous doctor who referred me to you. \\r\\nDoctor: Thank you. Let me take a look.  I see here it says you had severe sinusitis two to three months ago, correct? \\r\\nPatient:  Is that what they're calling my nasal problems? \\r\\nDoctor: Yeah, it is. Sinusitis is the inflammation of your nasal airways. \\r\\nPatient: I see. Thank you for describing it to me. \\r\\nDoctor: No problem. Would you be able to describe to me what you had been feeling two to three months ago? \\r\\nPatient: Yeah, I can. My face would feel uncomfortable, my nose was stuffy, my eyes hurt, and I felt something dropping in the back of my throat.\\r\\nDoctor: Have you ever been prescribed any medication? \\r\\nPatient: Here's the list of medicine I was taking. \\r\\nDoctor: I see you were given antibiotics, correct? \\r\\nPatient: I was, but I don't know what those are. Could you explain them to me? \\r\\nDoctor: Antibiotics are usually used to fight infections. \\r\\nPatient: I had an infection? I thought I just had some nasal problems. \\r\\nDoctor: Your report states you had a severe infection. Do you remember if the antibiotics helped? \\r\\nPatient: Not really. I felt like my symptoms were the same. \\r\\nDoctor: I see. Did your doctor order any advanced imaging's? \\r\\nPatient: Yeah. They did a C T scan of my nose. Here is the report from my C T scan. \\r\\nDoctor: Let me take a look. It looks like you had some thickening of the mucosal layer in your right paranasal sinus. You also had some obstruction in your right ostiomeatal complex and excess growing of some of the bones in your nose. Uhm. Oh, one more thing. I see your nasal septum was shifted to the left. \\r\\nPatient: Oh, wow. Thank you for explaining everything to me. \\r\\nDoctor: No problem. Going back to your list of medications, I know you took antibiotics for your infection, but did you take any medication for your sinuses? \\r\\nPatient: No, I haven't. I did try this cream for my nose, but that didn't work either. Nothing worked! \\r\\nDoctor: I see. Looks like the cream you used was a topical nasal corticosteroid. Are there any other symptoms that you have been experiencing? \\r\\nPatient: I've had some trouble with my balance, and I feel like I've lost some of my hearing. I thought this was odd since I'm only fifty years old. I think my ears felt plugged or full of air, so they just needed to pop. \\r\\nDoctor: I see. Let's perform an audiogram test to check your ears. \\r\\nPatient: Sounds good. \\r\\nDoctor: I'm seeing that you have some mild high frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Your tympanometry seems to be normal. Your speech discrimination was also normal. \\r\\nPatient: That's reassuring. \\r\\nDoctor: I want to ask a few more questions about your ears. Do you feel any fullness or pressure?  \\r\\nPatient: No, I don't feel anything like that right now. \\r\\nDoctor: Do you hear any humming, buzzing, or roaring sounds?\\r\\nPatient: Nope. I don't hear anything like that. \\r\\nDoctor: We checked your ears and now understand more about the problem, but I wonder why your balance is affected. When did you start noticing your balance was affected? \\r\\nPatient: I think it could have been to this one medicine that starts with an A. I forgot the name, but it didn't really help my nasal problems. It just made my balance worse. \\r\\nDoctor: Was the medicine called Allegra? \\r\\nPatient: Oh, yeah. That's what it was called. I thought I had some sort of allergy, so I thought it would help. \\r\\nDoctor: I see. Did you ever feel any dizziness too? \\r\\nPatient: Yeah, I did. \\r\\nDoctor: I will have you do some movements to see if your dizziness occurs. \\r\\nPatient: Sounds good. \\r\\nDoctor: Could you look to the left and then look to the right. \\r\\nPatient: Oh, wow. That made me very dizzy. \\r\\nDoctor: Looks like sudden movements and head turning make your dizziness worse.\",\n",

Her kneecap is partially dislocating, so this surgery will get everything back into alignment. \\r\\nGuest_family: Okay, what is the risk of infection?\\r\\nDoctor: The risk of infection is actually less than one percent.

Your heart was really beating very fast and then there was one more electrocardiogram which showed that your pacemaker is acting weird. \\r\\nPatient: They also did the same test this morning. \\r\\nDoctor: One they did this morning shows normal rate with frequent early heartbeats.

As she walked through the security, the alarm went off and like within seconds she was all surrounded, and everyone was like panicked. There was so much panic, they searched her and interrogated her and what not. Eventually she and her family made it to the flight, and she seemed unusually frustrated and disoriented by all that. Previously, if any such incident would have happened in the past, she would just have like chuckled and brushed it off. And we all would have sat together and laughed about it. This time it was different. \\r\\nDoctor: I can see why she was frustrated. Anyone can be in such situations. \\r\\nGuest_family: When we were in Colorado, she seemed slow.

He did a few blood tests and did uh, M R I of the brain. He gave us all clear. He said there\\'s nothing there. \\r\\nDoctor: Yeah, I see the working diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer\\'s Type. When did these symptoms increase? Like when did you started noticing them more? \\r\\nGuest_family: One or two weeks ago, so end of December nineteen ninety four, she got lost in her own home. She was getting more sensitive and started saying that she is becoming a liability for everyone, which is not at all like her. Her walking was affected.

I need to start catching things before they come, not after. \\r\\nDoctor: I could not agree more. From your last checkup notes, it looks like you had right knee surgery and back surgery about eighteen months ago. How is that going? Any pain?\\r\\nPatient: Yes, I had a right knee replacement. I am doing great so far. Nothing to complain about. I can do almost anything I desire now. It is such a good lifestyle change from before surgery. \\r\\nDoctor: What do you do with your new body?\\r\\nPatient: I travel every chance I get.

Do you have any coughing fits or irregular heart beating?\\r\\nPatient: No. \\r\\nDoctor: Great! You are getting a clean bill of health from me today. On the notes it says you have Crohn's disease. Are you getting regularly checked for that?\\r\\nPatient: Yes. Doctor Ferguson takes care of me for that. \\r\\nDoctor: Excellent. Are you scheduled for a prostate check?\\r\\nPatient: Yes, I go to Doctor Roszhart. \\r\\nDoctor: You are wonderfully on top of it. What a breath of fresh air. From all of your travelling, how are your ankles? Have you noticed any swelling?\\r\\nPatient: Surprisingly, from all the walking I do, I do not have any swelling. After quitting smoking ten years ago I had to get addicted to something else and that was walking and travelling.\",\n",

In the meantime, I'd like for you to see a specialist to make sure nothing else is going on. \\r\\nPatient: Alright, I'm good with that plan. \\r\\nDoctor: Are you having any other problems?

Hypopnea is shallow breathing. How has the device been working?\\r\\nPatient: It definitely has reduced my snoring, but my partner keeps waking me up in the middle of the night because the mask pops off. I wear it around five to seven nights a week, but for some reason it falls off or I take it off randomly in the night. My wife usually must remind me to put it back on. \\r\\nDoctor: So what is your sleep pattern now? When do you usually go to bed and wake up?\\r\\nPatient: Usually I sleep around eleven or eleven thirty and wake up at six or seven on the weekends. I'll sleep in until eight or nine on the weekdays. On Saturday's I might go to sleep around midnight because I usually watch a show with my family. I feel good when I wake up though. Much less tossing and turning. The sheets are always on the bed still. \\r\\nDoctor: That's some good news. I see you have lost a bit of weight too. Around fifteen to eighteen pounds is something to be proud of. \\r\\nPatient: Thanks. It has been a lot of exercising and dieting. I am motivated because I want to stop snoring. \\r\\nDoctor: How has work been? Do you think it has been stressful at all?\\r\\nPatient: I still work at Smith Barney in downtown Baltimore. I work from around eight or eight thirty to five or five thirty. I deal with training on how to sell managed funds and accounts. I do not think I have been stressed because I am able to stay awake through my shift and even when I come home at night.

We'll go in there with some hardware to put everything back together, and he can get on the road to healing. \\r\\nGuest_family: Let me call his father while we discuss this. What's the risk of infection from this surgery? \\r\\nDoctor: Historically, it's less than one percent. We use antibiotics to control for infection. \\r\\nGuest_family: Okay, will he be asleep for this? \\r\\nDoctor: Yes, he won't feel a thing.\\r\\nGuest_family: That's good too. Will he need this hardware out in the future?\\r\\nDoctor: We can remove everything once he has healed up nicely. Other risks include bleeding, changes in the sensation of the leg, hardware failure, need for post op rehab, need for hardware removal, and failure to restore extensor mechanism tension.
